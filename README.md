# googleNewsFilter
My first practice for Google chrome extension development and sorry for my poor English.  @.@
Inspired by someone who filter "韓國瑜" in FB.
Google news is a good portal for reading news.
But, why somebody are always on the media? Why we're forced to read their news? I don't care What happened to them!
I think the life should be beautiful and we shouldn't waste time to see someone's news that doesn't useful to us at all.
So this is a very basic example to understand how to build a simple extension and replace it to the words that you want to see.
From this example, you can discover how to read txt file, how to replace the HTML tag but how to pack it is not included. Because I didn't learn it yet, ha ha!

This is just a practice, just take it easy.(I know somebody would very SERIOUS, CC.)
You can just download it and change Chrome's setting to install it by yourself.  Remember to turn develper mode on.

Notice:
1. Please modify content of "keywords.json" file to what you want to deal with. And then install it from Chrome.
2. You can change code by your own, no copyright.

言簡意賅：
有個傢伙寫了在FB過濾韓國瑜新聞的Chrome擴充功能，我覺得很好，正巧我在閱讀Google News有相同的困擾，所以偷師他的程式碼做出我需要的功能。
我從沒寫過擴充程式，也利用此機會學到如何開發…。

人生應該保持單純，生活才快樂，演算法餵我們的，未必是我們要的。
