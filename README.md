# googleNewsFilter
My first practice for Google chrome extension development.

Inspired by someone who filter "韓國瑜" in FB.

Google news is a good portal for reading news.

But I think the life should be beautiful and we shouldn't waste time to see someone's news that doesn't useful to us at all.

So this is a very basic example to understand how to build a simple extension and replace it to the words that you want to see.

From this example, you can discover how to read txt file, how to replace the HTML tag but how to pack it is not included. Because I didn't learn it yet, ha ha!

This is just a practice, just take it easy.(I know somebody would very SERIOUS, CC.)

You can just download it and change Chrome's setting to install it yourself.  Remember to turn develper mode on.

Any one who lived in Republic of China are all free.

Notice:
1. Please modify content of "keywords.json" file to what you want to deal with. And then install it from Chrome.
2. You can change code by your own, no copyright.
